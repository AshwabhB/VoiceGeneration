# Voice Generation Project - Data Flow Documentation

This document explains the data flow and processing pipeline between the three main modules of the voice generation system.

## Module Overview

### 1. Audio Processor (`audio_processor.py`)
The foundational module handling all audio processing tasks.

**Key Components:**
- `AudioProcessor` class
- Audio loading and preprocessing
- Mel spectrogram conversion
- Chunk splitting and recombination
- Feature extraction

### 2. Generator (`improved_generator.py`)
Contains the neural network models for voice conversion.

**Key Components:**
- `ImprovedGenerator`: Main generator network
- `ImprovedDiscriminator`: Discriminator network
- `LearnableScaling`: Handles normalization
- `ResidualBlock`: Building block for the network
- `GlobalStats`: Manages global statistics for normalization

### 3. Voice Converter (`voice_converter_v2.py`)
Orchestrates the voice conversion process.

**Key Components:**
- `ImprovedVoiceDataset`: Handles data loading and preprocessing
- `EnhancedVoiceConverter`: Main conversion class

## Data Flow Pipeline

### 1. Initial Data Loading and Preprocessing
```python
# In ImprovedVoiceDataset
audio = self.audio_processor.load_audio(audio_path)
mel_spec = self.audio_processor.audio_to_mel(audio)
```

- Audio files are loaded and normalized
- Converted to mel spectrograms
- Global statistics are tracked for normalization

### 2. Time-Based Segmentation
```python
# In ImprovedVoiceDataset
mel_spec_norm = mel_spec_norm[:, start:start + self.segment_length]
```

- Audio is split into fixed-length segments (8192 frames by default)
- Each segment is normalized using global statistics
- Ensures consistent input size for the neural network

### 3. Chunk Processing
```python
# In AudioProcessor
def split_audio_into_chunks(self, mel_spec, chunk_size=8192, overlap=0.5):
    chunks = []
    positions = []
    # ... splits into overlapping chunks
```

- Mel spectrograms are split into overlapping chunks
- Each chunk is processed independently
- Overlap (0.5 by default) ensures smooth transitions
- Handles both small and large audio files efficiently

### 4. Generator Processing
```python
# In EnhancedVoiceConverter
for chunk_type, chunk, start_idx, end_idx in chunks:
    chunk_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(chunk).unsqueeze(0).to(self.device)
    converted_chunk = self.generator(chunk_tensor)
```

- Each chunk is processed by the generator
- The generator applies voice conversion to each chunk
- Maintains temporal consistency across chunks
- Handles both source and target voice characteristics

### 5. Chunk Recombination
```python
# In AudioProcessor
def combine_chunks(self, chunks, original_length):
    # ... combines chunks with crossfading
```

- Processed chunks are recombined with crossfading
- Overlapping regions are blended smoothly
- Maintains audio quality and continuity
- Handles edge cases and varying chunk sizes

### 6. Feature Matching and Enhancement
```python
# In EnhancedVoiceConverter
blended_stats = {
    'mean': (1 - spectral_blend) * tts_stats['mean'] + spectral_blend * target_stats['mean'],
    'std': (1 - spectral_blend) * tts_stats['std'] + spectral_blend * target_stats['std'],
    # ...
}
```

- Source and target voice features are blended
- Different aspects are matched:
  - Pitch characteristics
  - Duration and timing
  - Stress patterns
  - Spectral features
  - Prosody
  - Breath characteristics
  - Micro-variations
