# AudioRegenerator Changelog

## Version 1.1.0 - Major Optimization and Quality Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced sample rate from 22050Hz to 16000Hz for faster processing
- Reduced mel bands from 80 to 64 for more efficient computation
- Reduced segment length from 16384 to 8192 for faster training
- Reduced hop length from 4096 to 2048 for better efficiency
- Increased batch size from 16 to 32 for faster training
- Added spectrogram caching to avoid reprocessing audio files
- Reduced number of epochs from 50 to 5 for initial training
- Added pin_memory=True for faster data transfer to GPU
- Implemented proper resume training from the last completed epoch

### Model Architecture Improvements
- Simplified Generator and Discriminator architectures
- Reduced hidden channels from 512 to 256
- Removed one layer from both encoder and decoder
- Simplified the discriminator architecture

### GAN Balance Mechanisms
- Added dynamic learning rate adjustment based on generator and discriminator losses
- Implemented conditional generator training to prevent mode collapse
- Added training ratio parameters (D_TRAIN_RATIO=2, G_TRAIN_RATIO=1)
- Added loss thresholds to skip training when one component is too strong/weak
- Implemented learning rate adjustment factors to maintain equilibrium
- Added tracking of learning rates over time

### Audio Generation Quality Improvements
- Implemented improved mel spectrogram reconstruction method
- Fixed masking strategy to consistently mask the end portion
- Added proper spectrogram denormalization
- Implemented post-processing for better audio quality
- Added pre-emphasis to enhance high frequencies
- Normalized final audio for consistent volume levels

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed TypeError in librosa.db_to_power by using proper reference value
- Fixed AttributeError with librosa.output.write_wav by using soundfile
- Improved error handling throughout the code

### Documentation and Monitoring
- Added detailed progress reporting during training
- Added epoch time tracking to monitor training speed
- Enhanced logging of generator and discriminator losses
- Added learning rate adjustment notifications

## Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release
- Basic implementation of conditional GAN for audio generation
- Integration with Module3's SpeechTranscriber for text prediction
- Two-phase approach: train on audio patterns, use text prediction during generation
- Support for resuming training based on dataset_changed flag
